## 🎓 Best Practices Established

### Testing Patterns ✅
1. **Permission-Aware Testing**
   - Always handle `PermissionDenied` gracefully
   - Log permission denials clearly
   - Tests work in both Reader and Writer modes

2. **Realistic Test Data**
   - Use existing resources when possible
   - Unique IDs for created resources
   - Cleanup in `finally` blocks always

3. **Comprehensive Error Coverage**
   - Test both success and failure paths
   - Validate error codes and messages
   - Use `BeOneOf()` for flexible assertions

4. **Infrastructure Discovery**
   - List operations verify resource types exist
   - Watch API validates streaming capabilities
   - Graceful handling of unsupported features

### Code Quality ✅
1. **Consistent Patterns**
   - All tests follow same structure
   - Helper methods reused across files
   - XML documentation on all tests

2. **Maintainability**
   - Clear test names describe behavior
   - Comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Simple, focused test methods

3. **Reliability**
   - No flaky tests
   - Proper cleanup prevents pollution
   - Timeout handling prevents hangs
