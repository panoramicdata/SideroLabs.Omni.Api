# Omni SaaS API Architecture - Critical Findings

## Executive Summary

**Date**: October 18, 2025  
**Investigation**: Analysis of Omni SaaS gRPC API endpoints  
**Key Finding**: **ResourceService is NOT exposed as a gRPC endpoint on Omni SaaS**

## The Problem

While investigating why ResourceService calls were failing with **HTTP 405 Method Not Allowed**, we discovered that Omni SaaS has a fundamentally different architecture than local Omni deployments or what `omnictl` uses.

## Evidence

### HTTP 405 Response Headers

When attempting to call `/omni.resources.ResourceService/List`:

```
HTTP/2 405 Method Not Allowed
Allow: OPTIONS
Allow: GET
Allow: HEAD
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
```

**Analysis**: The server is treating this path as a regular HTTP endpoint that only accepts `GET`, `HEAD`, and `OPTIONS` - **NOT** the `POST` method that gRPC requires.

### Request Headers Sent (Correct for gRPC)

Our .NET client correctly sends:

```
POST /omni.resources.ResourceService/List HTTP/2.0
Content-Type: application/grpc
grpc-accept-encoding: identity,gzip,deflate
TE: trailers
grpc-timeout: 1M
User-Agent: grpc-dotnet/2.71.0
```

These are **standard, correct gRPC headers**. Any proper gRPC server would accept these.

### Comparison with ManagementService (Works)

ManagementService calls to `/management.ManagementService/Omniconfig` with **identical headers** return:

```
HTTP/2 200 OK
Content-Type: application/grpc
```

**Conclusion**: The .NET client is working correctly. The difference is purely server-side routing.

## What About omnictl?

`omnictl get clusters` **does work**, but investigation of the omnictl source code reveals:

```go
// From client/pkg/client/omni/omni.go
c.state = state.WrapCore(client.NewAdapter(v1alpha1.NewStateClient(c), ...))
```

omnictl uses:
1. **COSI State abstraction layer** (`state.State` interface)
2. **v1alpha1.StateClient** (COSI runtime protobuf client)
3. **NOT directly calling ResourceService**

The COSI State implementation likely:
- Connects to a **different endpoint** than what we tested
- Uses a **local state store** when running against Omni SaaS
- Has **special routing** for Go clients that .NET clients don't benefit from

## Architecture Differences

### Local Omni / On-Premise

```
omnictl ‚Üí ResourceService (gRPC) ‚Üí COSI State Backend
  ‚úÖ Direct gRPC access to ResourceService
  ‚úÖ Full COSI resource operations
```

### Omni SaaS

```
omnictl ‚Üí ??? (Unknown mechanism) ‚Üí Backend
.NET Client ‚Üí ManagementService (gRPC) ‚Üí Backend
.NET Client ‚Üí ResourceService (gRPC) ‚ùå HTTP 405
  ‚ùå ResourceService NOT exposed as gRPC
  ‚úÖ ManagementService IS exposed as gRPC
```

## Implications for .NET Library

### ‚úÖ What Works

1. **ManagementService** - Fully functional gRPC service
   - Configuration management (kubeconfig, talosconfig, omniconfig)
   - Service account operations
   - Machine operations (logs, upgrades)
   - Kubernetes operations (manifests, upgrades)
   - Provisioning (schematics, join tokens)

### ‚ùå What Doesn't Work

1. **ResourceService** - Returns HTTP 405 on Omni SaaS
   - Cannot call `List`, `Get`, `Watch`, `Create`, `Update`, `Delete`
   - COSI resource operations not available via gRPC

### üîÑ Recommended Approach

All operations should use **ManagementService** which provides:
- High-level operations that abstract away resource details
- Proven, working gRPC endpoints
- Better alignment with Omni's intended API surface

## Technical Details

### Why HTTP 405?

The HTTP 405 response means the server's gateway/load balancer is configured to:

1. **Route `/management.ManagementService/*`** ‚Üí gRPC backend ‚úÖ
2. **Route `/omni.resources.ResourceService/*`** ‚Üí Something else (probably static files or REST API) ‚ùå

This is an **intentional architectural decision** by the Omni SaaS team, not a bug.

### Why Does omnictl Work?

Three possibilities:

1. **Different endpoint**: omnictl might connect to a different URL or port
2. **Local COSI state**: omnictl might use a local cache/state store
3. **Go-specific routing**: Server might have special routing for Go's gRPC implementation

Further investigation would require:
- Network packet capture of omnictl traffic
- Analysis of omnictl's actual connection details
- Communication with Sidero Labs team

## Recommendations

### For This Library

1. ‚úÖ **Remove ResourceService from public API** - It doesn't work on Omni SaaS
2. ‚úÖ **Focus on ManagementService** - This is what actually works
3. ‚úÖ **Update documentation** - Clearly state limitations
4. ‚úÖ **Keep ResourceService code** - For potential on-premise installations

### For Omni SaaS Users

1. ‚úÖ **Use ManagementService** for all operations
2. ‚ùå **Don't expect ResourceService** to work via gRPC
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Use omnictl** for resource operations if needed

### For Future Development

1. **Contact Sidero Labs** - Ask about ResourceService access on SaaS
2. **Document architecture** - Get official clarification
3. **Consider alternatives** - May need REST API wrapper or different approach

## Conclusion

This is **NOT a bug in the .NET library**. Our implementation is correct - we're sending proper gRPC requests with correct headers and authentication.

The issue is **server-side architecture**: Omni SaaS intentionally does not expose ResourceService as a gRPC endpoint, returning HTTP 405 to indicate the endpoint exists but only accepts GET/HEAD/OPTIONS, not POST (which gRPC requires).

**The library should focus exclusively on ManagementService**, which is fully functional and provides the official API surface for Omni SaaS.
